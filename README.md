# Kuku

* This was the formal project during my time at DevPoint Labs
* Kuku was conceived by Dan Actor and Pete Alberico; my team of 4 further enhanced the Web app.
* App is a 'tindr-like' shopping app. User can scroll through products, narrow down the search criteria, view specific items and chose to "Love" or "Don't Like".  Loved items went to the user's cart.  In the cart view users could tap on the Buy it Now button and go to the company's site to purchase.
* App written in React & CSS with Semantic UI.  We transitioned the database portion from FireBase to Rails.
