You need to be 18 or over to create an account and must be resident in the United Kingdom. If you are over 13 but under 18 then you can register to use the Service but only with your parent or guardian’s permission and you must get the bill payer’s permission before buying any Products.

              You may be asked to provide information about yourself such as your name, address and email address. Please make sure this information is complete and accurate.

            The Kuku Service
          </Accordion.Title>
          <Accordion.Content active={activeIndex === 4}>
            <p>
              Kuku acts only as a venue and marketplace which compiles, curates and displays a range of products (“Products”) from third party retailers (each a “Seller”) for you to discover great Products and transact with Sellers. While Kuku helps facilitate transactions that are carried out on the Service, Kuku does not provide or sell the Products and is not party to any transaction you may make with a Seller. This means that any contractual obligations arising out of a transaction using the Service are the responsibility of you and the Seller, not Kuku. These Terms, alongside the information found on the applicable product pages, form the basis of the contract between the Seller and you.
            </p>
            <p>
              Kuku does not have any responsibility for, or liability related to, any Product listed on the Service (including your order of the same). You should direct any questions, complaints or claims related to any Product to the relevant Seller.
            </p>

            Availability, Prices, Payment and Delivery
          </Accordion.Title>
          <Accordion.Content active={activeIndex === 5}>
            <p>
              Unless otherwise stated, all prices on the Service are inclusive of any VAT payable but exclude delivery charges. We use our reasonable efforts to ensure that the prices of Products displayed on the Service are correct. However, despite our reasonable efforts, it may be possible that some of the Products on the Service may be incorrectly priced. If an error in the price of the Products you have ordered is discovered, you will be contacted and given the option of reconfirming your order at the correct price or cancelling it.
            </p>
            <p>
              All Products offered on the Service are subject to availability or while stocks last. If you order a Product which is not in stock, no payment will be taken for that Product and we will notify you by email that the Product is not available. The availability and prices of Products may change from time to time. Any changes to prices will not affect any order that has been confirmed.
            </p>
            <p>
              Depending on the device you are using to access the Service and/or the particular Product you are purchasing, the Service may re-direct you to the website of the Seller of that Product in order to complete the transaction. Where you are re-directed to a third party website and once you leave the Service, we have no control over or responsibility for any purchase you make and the terms and conditions of that website will apply.
            </p>
            <p>
              By purchasing Products from the Service, you authorise Kuku to take payment for these Products through our payment processor partners (as described below). Kuku is authorised by the Sellers to accept your payment for Products purchased via the Service. You may pay for the Products using PayPal, Stripe and any other payment method which we may add to the Service from time to time. Although we offer a checkout on our site, the use of the checkout is for your convenience only. We act only as an agent on behalf of Sellers and payment in full will only be taken when the Seller has confirmed your order. Payment is made to the retailer on your behalf. Your use of any payment services to purchase Products will be subject to the terms and conditions of the applicable payment processor. 
            </p>
            <p>
              After you place an order to purchase Products through the Service, we will send you an email acknowledging that we have received your order. However, please note that this does not mean that your order has been accepted. Nothing that Kuku does or says will amount to any acceptance of your order. The Seller will also send you an email confirming that it has received your order but nothing that the Seller does or says will amount to any acceptance of your order until you receive an email from the Seller notifying you that it has despatched the Product(s).
            </p>
            <p>
              Delivery will be made to the address specified when you complete the order. Delivery of the Products will be made by the Seller or the Seller’s delivery partner and, unless specified otherwise, should be made within 30 days of the order being placed. The Seller is responsible for delivery of its Products, not Kuku. Delivery charges and estimated timescales are specified during the purchase process.

            Your Rights of Return, Refund and Cancellation
          </Accordion.Title>
          <Accordion.Content active={activeIndex === 6}>
            <p>
              If you are a consumer resident in the European Union, then you may have the right to return purchased Products for a refund within 14 days of you receiving the Products. Kuku is not a party to your transaction with the Seller and so you should contact the Seller directly regarding any cancellation, return or refund in relation to a Product. The Product(s) must be returned directly to the Seller and the Seller is responsible for issuing all refunds in relation to cancelled contracts and returned Products. These cancellation rights do not affect your legal rights.
            </p>
            <p>
              Although Kuku does not process any returns, refunds or cancellations of orders, you do have certain statutory rights to cancel a contract within 14 days from when you receive a Product. If, during this period, you change your mind or want to return a Product, you should notify the Seller, including details of your order, and return the Product to them. The Seller is responsible for refunding you the price you paid for the Product together with any standard delivery costs you paid (excluding any supplementary delivery costs paid such as for quicker delivery or gift wrapping). Any refund will be less any reduction in value of the Product which has been caused by your handling of it in any way which would not be permitted in a shop. You may wish to visit your local Citizens Advice Bureau for more information about your statutory rights.

            <p>
              We may from time to time provide interactive services on the Service.
            </p>
            <p>
              Where we do provide any interactive service, we will provide clear information to you about the kind of service offered, if it is moderated and what form of moderation is used (including whether it is human or technical).  
            </p>
            <p>
              We will do our best to assess any possible risks for Users (and in particular, for children) from third parties when they use any interactive service provided on the Service, and we will decide in each case whether it is appropriate to use moderation of the relevant service (including what kind of moderation to use) in the light of those risks. However, we are under no obligation to oversee, monitor or moderate any interactive service we provide on the Service, and we expressly exclude our liability for any loss or damage arising from the use of any interactive service by a User in contravention of our content standards, whether the service is moderated or not.  
            </p>
            <p>
              The use of any of our interactive services by a minor is subject to the consent of their parent or guardian. We advise parents who permit their children to use an interactive service that it is important that they communicate with their children about their safety online. Minors who are using any interactive service should be made aware of the potential risks to them.  
            </p>
            <p>
              Where we do moderate an interactive service, we will normally provide you with a means of contacting the moderator, should a concern or difficulty arise.

            <p>
              If Kuku does not comply with its obligations to you under these Terms or is negligent in providing the Service, Kuku is responsible for any loss or damage that you suffer which is a “foreseeable result” of such breach or negligence. Loss or damage is a foreseeable result if it is an obvious consequence of our failure to comply with these Terms.
            </p>
            <p>
              BECAUSE Kuku IS NEITHER THE BUYER NOR THE SELLER OF THE PRODUCTS, IF A DISPUTE ARISES CONCERNING A PRODUCT, BOTH YOU AND THE APPLICABLE SELLER RELEASn Kuku (INCLUDING ITS EMPLOYEES, AGENTS AND GROUP COMPANIES) FROM CLAIMS, DEMANDS AND DAMAGES OF EVERY KIND AND NATURE ARISING OUT OF OR IN ANY WAY CONNECTED WITH SUCH DISPUTES.
            </p>
            <p>
              As a consumer, you are entitled to various statutory warranties (including, for example, that any service is carried out with reasonable skill and care, and any product purchased is of satisfactory quality). Nothing in these Terms shall have the effect of excluding or limiting those implied statutory warranties which may not be excluded or limited under applicable law. 
            </p>
            <p>
              Nothing in these Terms limits or excludes our liability for: (i) death or personal injury caused by our negligence; (ii) fraudulent misrepresentation; or (iii) any other liability that cannot be excluded by law.

              We may terminate these Terms at any time if: (a) you breach these Terms; (b) you become or threaten to become insolvent or bankrupt; or (c) we decide to suspend or terminate the Service.
            </p>
            <p>
              These Terms do not affect your legal rights. For more information about your legal rights in relation to any Product purchased that is faulty or is not as described, you may wish to visit your local Citizens Advice Bureau or Trading Standards Office.
            </p>
            <p>
              You agree to compensate and reimburse Kuku fully for any claims or legal proceedings which are brought against Kuku as a result of your breach of these Terms or misuse.
            </p>
            <p>
              No other person has any rights to enforce any of these Terms.
            </p>
            <p>
              You may not transfer your rights or obligations under these Terms to anyone else without our written permission. We may transfer our rights and obligations to another party, but this will not affect your rights or our obligations to you under these Terms.
            </p>
            <p>
              Each of the paragraphs in these Terms operates separately. If any courts or relevant authority decide that any of them are unlawful or unenforceable, the remaining paragraphs will remain in full force and effect.
            </p>
            <p>
              The User’s use of the Service, including any dispute or claim arising out of or in connection with it, will be governed by English law. Kuku and each User both agree that the courts of England and Wales shall have the non-exclusive jurisdiction.
